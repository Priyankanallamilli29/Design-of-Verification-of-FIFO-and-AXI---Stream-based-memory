# Design-of-Verification-of-FIFO-and-AXI---Stream-based-memory
Implemented an AXI-stream based memory interface for efficient data transfer between master and memory blocks. Developed system Verilog test bench with mailbox-based communication, generator and driver classes.Verified the read/write operations through simulation.
